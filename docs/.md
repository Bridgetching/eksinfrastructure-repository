### Amazon DynamoDB

Used for:

* Serverless, low-latency workloads

  # What’s Intentionally Excluded

To keep this repository focused, the following are excluded:
- Full application source code
- Secrets management solutions
- Centralized observability stacks
- Multi-region disaster recovery

These can be added without modifying the core architecture.

  # Design Decisions

This project prioritizes clarity, modularity, and production realism.

Key decisions:
- Terraform modules to enable reuse across environments
- GitOps (Argo CD) to eliminate configuration drift
- Separation of infrastructure and application delivery

# Design Decisions

## Why This Structure?
- Encourages module reusability and separation of concerns
- Mirrors real enterprise cloud architectures
- Scales from single-account to multi-account environment
